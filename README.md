# NLP_Chat_Bot
Human language is astoundingly complex and diverse. When we write, we often misspell or abbreviate words, or omit punctuation. There is a lot of unstructured data around us. Natural language processing helps computers communicate with humans in their own language and scales other language-related tasks. NLP makes it possible for computers to read text, interpret it, measure sentiment and determine which parts are important.

Understanding this will enable you to build the core component of any conversational chatbot. In this NLP application we will create the core engine of a chat bot. We will learn text classification using the techniques of natural language processing by using the nltk library.

In this NLP AI application, we build the core conversational engine for a chatbot. We use the popular NLTK text classification library to achieve this.
